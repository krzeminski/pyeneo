    Attributes
    -----------
    name : str
        String representing an Item name
    quantity : int
        Represents quantity of a single Item wanted by user. It should
        be greater then 0.
    price_min : int
        Represents the lower price boundary for the Item. It needs to be
        less than price_max.
    price_max : int
        Represents the higher price boundary for the Item. It needs to be
        greater than price_min.
    min_reputation : int
        Represents the minimal reputation of the seller. It needs to be
        in the range of <1, 5>
    url : str
        It is the url used for the first request to the website.
    timestamp : str
        Consists of a date and time of the first request to the website.
        It is a return value of datetime.now().__str__()

    Methods
    -----------
    create_url()
        Based on the Skapiec.pl RESTish API it creates url and sets the (TODO: figure out WHICH URL. Search? Product? Maybe the final offer (external shop)?) object parameter url to it.
    set_and_get_timestamp()
        Sets the object's timestamp to string representation of datetime.now().
        It also returns that value.
    validate_item(item_name, quantity, min_price, max_price, min_reputation)
        It is a factory (classmethod) for creating Items from a form sent by user.
        It contains data validation and raises exceptions if something is wrong
        with the data.
